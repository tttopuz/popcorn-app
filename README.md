#Popcorn time [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/popcorn-team/popcorn-app.svg?theme=shields.io)](https://david-dm.org/popcorn-team/popcorn-app)

## Idea

To allow any computer user to watch movies easily streaming from torrents, without any particular knowledge.

![Demo Screenshot](http://static.cdnjd.com/imgs/how-ui.png)

### Status

Under development (RC1) for Mac OSX - Windows - Linux.

### APIs

**Currently used:**
- [YIFY](http://yts.re/api) movie torrents API.
- [OpenSubtitles](http://trac.opensubtitles.org/projects/opensubtitles/wiki/XMLRPC) for subtitles
- [TheMovieDB](http://www.themoviedb.org/) for movies metadata.

## Dependencies

You will need nodejs and grunt:

    $ npm install -g grunt-cli

And ruby with compass to build the stylesheets. Read [this](http://thesassway.com/beginner/getting-started-with-sass-and-compass) for more information.

## Running and debugging

Run at least once to install dependencies and generate css files.

    $ npm install
    $ grunt

Run compass in Terminal for CSS compiling and listen to future changes.

    $ compass watch --css-dir css

Run node-webkit from the root directory with --debug to enable debugging mode like so

    $ node-webkit . --debug

or

    $ nw . --debug

Press F12 to display the dev tools. Enjoy!

- Currently Gaze to watch all files and reload the app is disabled due to memory leaks and instability.

## Build

Install the node modules:


Build with:

    $ grunt build

By default it will build for your current platform however you can control that
by specifying a comma separated list of platforms in the `platforms` option to
grunt:

    $ grunt build --platforms=linux32,linux64,mac,win

You can also build for all platforms with:

    $ grunt build --platforms=all

### Error about missing libudev.so.0
Search for libudev.0 on your distribution. Most of the time it can be easily fixed by creating a symbolic link from libudev.so to libudev.so.0
